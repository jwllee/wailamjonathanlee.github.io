I presented about my work on recomposing conformance checking of process mining at the AIS group meeting and had received some feedback and new ideas.

The presentation was a joint effort with my supervisor Jorge Munoz-Gama who gave a high level view of our process mining group in Chile.

The slides can be found [here](/assets/docs/slides.pptx).
