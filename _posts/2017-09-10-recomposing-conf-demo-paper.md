In the area of process mining, efficient alignment-based conformance checking alignment-based conformance checking is a hot topic. This accepted paper presents the tool Replay with Recomposition which returns the exact fitness value and the resulting alignments using the decomposition approach in an iterative manner. Other than computing the exact fitness value, users can configure the balance between result accuracy and computation time to get a fitness interval within set constraints, e.g., "Give me the best fitness estimation you can find within 5 minutes."

The tool is an implementation of the technique presented in the technical report: [Technical Report on Closing the Circle on Decomposed Alignment-Based Conformance Checking in Process Mining through Recomposing Conformance](http://pmuc.ing.puc.cl/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/TRISCI17.pdf).
